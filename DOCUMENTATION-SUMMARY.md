## ⚠️ Important Notes

### What This IS
- ✅ Complete documentation template structure
- ✅ Professional forensic investigation framework
- ✅ Team collaboration guide
- ✅ Academic project support

### What This IS NOT
- ❌ A solution to the M57-Jean case (you must investigate!)
- ❌ Pre-filled with findings (you document your discoveries)
- ❌ A replacement for learning (you must understand the process)
- ❌ A shortcut (proper forensics takes time and effort)

### Academic Integrity
- **DO** use these templates to document your work
- **DO** conduct your own investigation
- **DO** analyze the evidence yourself
- **DON'T** use published M57-Jean solutions from the internet
- **DON'T** copy others' analysis
- **DON'T** plagiarize documentation

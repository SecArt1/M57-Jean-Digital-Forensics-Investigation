## Case Background Research

**Completed by:** [Team Member Name]  
**Date:** [Date]

### Scenario Summary

**Company:** M57.Biz (small startup)  
**Incident:** Confidential employee salary spreadsheet posted to competitor's website  
**Subject:** Jean (Senior Officer)

**Evidence Available:** Jean's laptop disk image

### Investigation Objectives

1. Determine how confidential data was exfiltrated from Jean's laptop
2. Establish whether Jean was complicit or compromised
3. Create comprehensive timeline of events
4. Identify all instances of data leakage or compromise
5. Document evidence using forensically sound procedures

### Known Facts

- Spreadsheet contained names and salaries of key employees
- Document existed only on Jean's laptop
- Posted to competitor's website comments section
- Incident occurred approximately [timeframe from scenario materials]
